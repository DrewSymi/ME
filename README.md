### **Hello, I'm Andrew Symister**

I'm a technical support engineer with a deep interest in cybersecurity, specifically in Identity and Access Management (IAM). My background in troubleshooting and supporting users in technical environments has provided me with valuable experience in access controls and security practices, and I am now eager to transition into a more specialized IAM role.


### **Objective**

My objective is to leverage my technical support experience to move into IAM, focusing on user access management, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and implementing best practices for securing digital identities. I am particularly interested in roles involving cloud IAM solutions like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud and aim to help organizations manage and secure user identities while ensuring compliance with industry standards.
